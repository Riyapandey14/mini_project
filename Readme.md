## Project Tech. Analysis :

- Flexiblity : Due to the **independent views** the routes can always be modified into any form thus providing the code flexiblity to be used as another *front-end* modification. Also due to the **Mongo** modern database connectivity the website *back-end* is also highly flexible to work on different schemas.

- Scalability : The model of the routes that has been used with the website is *GET* ,*POST* ,*CREATE* ,*DELETE* .The routes can be extended to any level for different forms of views loading or Rendering.

- Adaptability : Adaptability of the project can be extended to any level by incorporation of different technologies into the domain like *Data Science*, *Machine Learing*, *Artificial Intelligence*, *Search BOTS* . The project from the very start is planned in so very way for the incorporation of various tech. integrations and to provide more adaptable solutions.

- Security : The website is secured by Node Express-Sanitizer script 
 - > npm install express
 - > npm install express-sanitizer
 - > **In app.js** require("express-sanitizer")
